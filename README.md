## Assembly

For the PIR, duponts were crimped on both ends of the leads to make it easier to mount/unmount in the enclosure.

The LED was soldered to the leads with the resistor (330 ohm) directly on the anode post and buried in heat shrink.
Duponts were used on the Pi side to make it easier to mount/unmount. 

On the Pi, pin headers were used rather than solder directly to the pads.

Leads are 22AWG.
